## Ionic introduction

To run the program:

- If you already have Ionic installed you can skip this step, other wise, run `npm i -g @ionic/cli`
- Inside `codenotch-client` folder run `ǹpm install`
- To visualize in the browser without exporting the project `ìonic serve`
- To export the project to android run `ionic cordova add android` 

This project only includes the client, it does NOT include the Rest api server nor the database.
