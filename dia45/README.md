# day 45

## Angular + NodeJS Rest API + mongodb

Fullstack project using angular for the client, Node as the database Gateway. It is the same client from the project from day 44 but configured to be used with mongoDB instead of mysql

To run the project

- Inside each folder, run ```npm install```
- Inside client ```ng serve --open```
- Inside API ```node index.js```

The API assumes that mongoDB is running and there's a database called ```Angular```, with a collection called ```discos``` in the default port
