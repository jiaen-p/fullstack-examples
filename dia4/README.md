## Loops
- for-loop syntax
- while-loop syntax

Most of the times we use for loops because they are simple to use, sometimes they are not as efficient as while loops can be, thats because you can set certain conditions in while loops that can kick you out of the loop without the need of an break statement when the conditions are met, specially when the loop is used to find if an item is in the array or not.
